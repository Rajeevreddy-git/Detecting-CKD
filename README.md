# Detecting-Chronic Kidney Disease

---

Detecting-CKD is a machine learning-based project aimed at identifying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical data. It leverages data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms to predict CKD presence with high accuracy. The goal is to support early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes through data-driven insights.

Features
 - Cleaned and preprocessed CKD dataset
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for feature understanding
 - Multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
 - Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
 - Scalable and modular codebase for experimentation

Tech Stack
 - Python
 (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - Git & GitHub for version control
 
Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease)
